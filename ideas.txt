1. I could have somethig like this, where after a few seconds the page darkens with a search light 
focussing on the next section and a ghost eye saying i know you wanna know more...maybe I can add 
some sound effects and make that ghiost eye(just liek int he example) say stuff.

2. Maybe I could add a background effect like this and then enhance it to have a game like scenario 
where in the blocks there may be snakes and villains, no actually Green Code Bugs(sign of actual code bugs in coding)
that will come and try to do something, like maybe try eat the cursor or slow the cursor movement even if the user tries 
to move it when the bugs are near and to remove them or push them away you have to hover over those bugs to make them run away for a while.

Also I could use idea one to basically highlight the bugs for a sec, telling the user that now you gotta avoid them.

and the bugs could say, We can't let you see the genius of this guy, I can't let you destroy us bugs.
